## Abstract
Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a global health challenge, ranking among the most diagnosed cancers with high mortality rates. Understanding its genetic complexity and metastatic potential is crucial for prognosis and treatment. Leveraging single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data, our study explores spatial neighborhoods in primary CRC tumors. Integrated analysis reveals differential cellular composition and transcriptional profiles, shedding light on spatial determinants of CRC metastasis, vital for improving patient outcomes.
